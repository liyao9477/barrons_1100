### THE SEARCH FOR THE DOG (CONTINUED)

Meanwhile, the Harts had notified the local radio stations to broadcast a **poignant** appeal for the dog’s owner to come forward. The station was **inundated** with phone calls, but all leads were **fruitless**. From what Bobby had told them, a huge dog had **leaped out** from a red station **wagon** in the supermarket’s parking lot. After biting Bobby it vanished. The six-year-old was too concerned with the bites he had received to see where the dog had gone. The boy’s story was **garbled**, but he did remember that the animal was gray and had a collar. There was little tangible* evidence to go on, but the police remained **sanguine**.

### NO RELIEF

The normally **phlegmatic** Jerry Hart was deeply upset. Twenty-four hours had passed without results, and even if the rabies could not be **corroborated**, Jerry was determined to see that his son received the vaccine. At the suggestion of some friends, he organized a **comprehensive** search party, **zealously** fanning out in circles around the supermarket. They knocked on every door, inspected every dog, and came back empty-handed. Although the Harts were sick with worry (they had to be **coerced** into going to sleep), little Bobby seemed to be in great spirits. The excruciating* **vigil** continued.

### THE POLICE FIND THE DOG

Forty hours had **elapsed** before the police work and the publicity paid off. By **meticulously** checking the registrations of every red station wagon in the neighborhood and then cross-checking dog licenses, the police narrowed the search to four owners. After a few telephone calls, the apologetic owner was located and directed to bring her muzzled German shepherd to the Hart **domicile**. Bobby identified the dog, and the animal was taken to a **veterinary’s clinic** to have the necessary tests performed. The **lax** owner, Mrs. McGraw, admitted that the dog had a **sporadic** mean streak, but she scoffed* at the idea of rabies. Jerry Hart noticed for the first time in two days that his uneasy feeling had departed.

### ALL’S WELL THAT ENDS WELL

The Harts were greatly relieved to learn that the **rash** **conjecture** about the dog was not true. Because the German shepherd was not rabid, the necessity for the painful treatment was **obviated**. The police gave the dog’s owner a **summons** for allowing the animal to go **unmuzzled**. Little Bobby was treated to an ice cream sundae and a Walt Disney double feature. The neighbors searched for other **lurid** happenings, and Jerry Hart went back to his office. “What kind of dog was that?” his secretary asked. “Oh, his bark was worse than his bite,” **quipped** Jerry.

### OFF BROADWAY

When Monte Ziltch told his boss, Mr. Foy, that he was quitting as an accountant to become an actor, the man was **convulsed** with laughter. After Mr. Foy realized that Monte was obsessed* with the idea, he became quite serious, **launching** into a **diatribe** on the importance of responsibility in the younger generation. Monte **confessed** that he had been developing **ulcers** as an accountant, and when his psychiatrist suggested that the sickness was a result of **inhibitions**, Monte agreed. Now a **fortuitous** opportunity to get into show business required Monte to make an immediate decision. Mr. Foy **stormed** out of the office, **muttering** **incoherently** about hippies, millennials, and others of that **ilk**.

### AN ALL-ROUND MAN

The need for a decision came about when Monte was invited to join a **prestigious** summer stock company, starting in mid-June. As a **mature** “**apprentice**,” he would be required to take tickets, paint scenery, prepare **placards**, assist with lighting, **costumes**, and **props**, and carry an occasional **spear** in a **walk-on** role. Since the company would **stage** five major plays during the summer, as well as a half-dozen shows for children, there was a chance that Monte might actually get a part before too many weeks had elapsed.* In addition, he would be attending the drama classes that were an **integral** part of the summer **theater**. The **remuneration** would be **nominal**, but at last Monte Ziltch would be fulfilling a life-long ambition.

### FROM LEDGERS TO SCRIPTS

During the first weeks of the summer, Monte Ziltch didn’t even have time to consider whether he had made an egregious* mistake. He was too engrossed* in his work, performing a thousand and one odd jobs around the theater. First there was the **opening production** of A Chorus Line, then two weeks of The Fantasticks, followed by a poignant* The Diary of Anne Frank, which did excellent business. All through those weeks, Monte painted, carried, **nailed**, collected, ran, studied, and **perspired**. He had **expunged** all traces of debits and credits from his mind, burying himself in the more **flamboyant** world of the theater. Accounting became **anathema** to him as the **schism** between his present **utopia** and his former drudgery* **widened**.

### IRONY FOR MERRYWEATHER

At last, Monte’s chance to perform came. He had played the **timorous** Lion in a truncated version of The Wizard of Oz, which the apprentices had **staged**. But now there was an open **audition** to cast the final show of the season. It was to be a **jaunty** original comedy, given a summer **tryout** **prior** **to** **a Broadway opening**. Monte, who by now had adopted the stage name of Monte Merryweather, read for the producers, hoping to get the part of the hero’s **fractious** **landlord**. Unfortunately, the competition was too tough—but the director assigned Monte to a less **ostentatious** part. And so for the first two weeks in September the **stage-struck** accountant had a two-minute, two-line part. What was his role? The hero’s accountant!

### A VISIT TO THE PRESIDENT

In the winter of 1941, Enrico Fermi and a number of other **distinguished** scientists **importuned** President Franklin Roosevelt for authorization to begin an all-out effort in atomic energy research. The scientists were alarmed by **incontrovertible** evidence of **surreptitious** German experiments, and they asked for **speedy** approval. Italian-born Enrico Fermi was the ideal man to lead the atomic research. Already in 1938 he had won the Nobel Prize for work with **radioactive** elements and **neutron bombardment**. Fermi had found a **haven** from the **Fascists** (his wife was Jewish) and he knew that if the Germans were the first to develop an atomic bomb it would mean that Hitler could **subjugate** the entire world. The international race for atomic **supremacy** was on.

### THE ULTIMATE WEAPON TAKES SHAPE (Ultimate)

Enrico Fermi designed a device that could **eventuate** in a chain reaction. It consisted of layers of **graphite**, alternated with chunks of **uranium**. The uranium **emitted** neutrons, and the graphite slowed them down. Holes were left for long **cadmium** safety rods. By **withdrawing** those **control rods** Fermi could speed up the production of neutrons, thus increasing the number of uranium atoms that would be split (fission). When the rods were withdrawn to a critical point, then the neutrons would be produced so fast that the graphite and cadmium could not **absorb** them. In that manner a chain reaction would result. Slowly, Fermi’s first **atomic pile** began to grow in a **subterranean** room at Columbia University. The big question remained—was it **viable**?

### THE SQUASH COURT EXPERIMENT

As the **pile** grew, so did the entire project. Fermi moved his materials to an abandoned **squash court** under a football **stadium** at the University of Chicago. His pace **accelerated** because they were proceeding **on the** **premise** that the Germans were close to atomic success. Six weeks after the pile had been started, its **critical size** was reached. Three brave young men **jeopardized** **their lives** by ascending* the pile, ready to cover it with liquid cadmium if anything went wrong. Almost fifty scientists and several **incredulous** observers **mounted** a **balcony** to watch. One physicist remained on the floor; it was his job to extract the final cadmium control rod. Unbearable tension **permeated** the atmosphere. Fermi completed his calculations, waited for a **propitious** moment, and then gave the signal.

### THE ITALIAN NAVIGATOR LANDS (Navigator)

The chain reaction took place **precisely** as Enrico Fermi had **surmised**. After twenty-eight minutes he **curtailed** the experiment, giving the signal to replace the control rod. The normally **reserved** scientists, unable to **repress** their excitement, let out a tremendous cheer and gathered around Fermi to shake his hand. Although it was time to celebrate, some of the men remarked **soberly** that “the world would never be the same again.” On December 2, 1942, the news of Fermi’s achievement was **relayed** in a **cryptic** telephone message:

“The Italian Navigator has reached the New World.” 

“And how did he find the natives?” 

“Very friendly.”

The Atomic Age was **inchoate**—but truly here!

### SUNDAY MORNING AT PEARL HARBOR (Pearl Harbor)

At breakfast time on Sunday morning, December 7, 1941, Dorie Miller was serving coffee aboard the battleship West Virginia. Dorie was black, and the highest job to which he could then **aspire** in the U.S. Navy was that of **messman**. While Dorie was technically a member of a great fighting **fleet**, he was not expected to fight. Most Army and Navy officers **inveighed** against blacks as **fighting men**. Although blacks were **nettled** by such **overt prejudice**, Dorie Miller **apparently** accepted being **relegated** to the role of a **messhall** servant. Now, as he poured the coffee, Dorie was wondering why the airplanes above were making so much noise on a peaceful Sunday morning.

### THE INFAMOUS* ATTACK

The coffee cups suddenly went **spinning** as an explosion knocked Dorie Miller flat on his back. Jumping up from his **supine** **position**, the powerfully built messman from Waco, Texas, headed for the **deck**. Everywhere that Dorie looked he saw smoke and **mammoth** warships lying on their sides. Overhead, dozens of Japanese **dive bombers** controlled the skies without a U.S. plane to **repulse** their attack. The **havoc** was enormous. Without hesitating, Dorie joined a team that was feeding **ammunition** to a machine gunner who was making an ineffectual* attempt to protect their battleship from being **razed** by the **torpedo planes**.

### THE HEROISM OF DORIE MILLER

Men all around Miller were succumbing* to the **lethal** **spray** of Japanese bullets. He dragged his captain to safety and turned back to see that the **machine-gunner** had been killed. Dorie took the big gun and **trained** it on the incoming bombers. Within the space of ten minutes, he was credited with destroying four bombers while **dodging** the bullets of their **fighter escorts**. The enemy **scurried** away, having struck the **incisive** blow that **precipitated** U.S. entrance into World War II. **Amidst** the dead bodies and the ruined fleet were the heroes such as Dorie Miller. The Navy had told him that he did not have to fight, but he hadn’t listened. The Navy had attempted to maintain a **stereotype** of him, but Dorie changed all that.

### “FOR DISTINGUISHED DEVOTION TO DUTY”

Some months later, Dorie Miller was serving on an aircraft carrier when Admiral Chester Nimitz, the commander of the Pacific Fleet, came aboard to **preside** over a special awards ceremony. In **stentorian** **tones** the **admiral** presented Miller with the prestigious* Navy Cross, **commending** him for a **singular** act of **valor** and “disregard for his own personal safety.” Miller’s heroism helped to **shatter** the bias against African-Americans in the armed forces. Although he could have accepted a **sinecure** at a U.S. naval base, Dorie chose to remain in the **combat zone** where he was killed in action in December 1943.

### DANNY ESCOBEDO GOES TO JAIL

In 1960, a young Chicagoan, Danny Escobedo, was given a 20-year jail **sentence** for first-degree murder. Danny had confessed to **complicity** in the killing of his brother-in-law after the police had refused to allow him to see his lawyer. Actually, Danny was tricked into blaming a friend for the **liquidation** of his sister’s husband, thereby establishing himself as an **accomplice**. Despite the fact that Danny later **recanted** his confession, he was found **culpable** and jailed. Danny had been stereotyped* as a **hoodlum** and nobody **raised an eyebrow over** the hapless* felon’s* troubles.

### ESCOBEDO’S LAWYER APPEALS

Barry Kroll, a Chicago lawyer, took an interest in Danny Escobedo’s case. Kroll felt that his client’s rights under the Constitution had been **abrogated**. Since the **alleged** accomplice,* Escobedo, had been denied access to an **attorney**, Kroll asked the courts to **invalidate** the conviction. He proposed that lawyers be **entitled** to sit in when the police question a suspect, but the **Illinois** courts rejected that **on the grounds** that it would effectively **preclude** all questioning by legal authorities. If such a law were **upheld**, the police felt that it would play havoc* with all criminal investigations.

### A HISTORIC SUPREME COURT RULING

Lawyer Kroll **persevered** in his defense of Danny Escobedo. The case was argued before the Supreme Court, and in 1964, in a **landmark** decision, the Court reversed Danny’s conviction. Legal aid, said the judges, must be instantly available to a suspect. “A system of law enforcement that comes to depend on the confession,” one justice declared, “will, in the long run, be less reliable than a system that depends on **extrinsic** evidence independently secured through skillful investigation.” A justice who **declaimed** against the decision said, however, “I think the rule is ill-conceived and that it seriously **fetters** perfectly legitimate methods of criminal **enforcement**.”

### THE EFFECTS OF THE ESCOBEDO DECISION

After Danny Escobedo’s release from prison, hundreds of **inmates** began **lawsuits** for their freedom **on the grounds** that their rights had been violated, too. Each case was heard **on its merits**, and in numerous instances people who had been convicted of serious offenses were freed because of the new standards established in the Escobedo case. After getting out, Danny was not a **paragon** of **virtue**, according to the police. He led a **nomadic** existence, **drifting** from job to job, and was arrested frequently. Danny referred to police harassment* with **asperity**, and a few choice **epithets**. Although the Escobedo case was a **controversial** one, most agree that it inspired better police training, improved law enforcement **procedures**, and increased scientific crime detection.

### MEET THE BEES

One of the most interesting **inhabitants** of our world is the bee, an insect that is **indigenous** to all parts of the globe except the polar regions. The **honeybee** is a **gregarious** insect whose habitat is a colony that he shares with as many as 80,000 bees. Although the individual bees live for only a few days, their colony can be operative for several years. A **cursory** study of the activities of these insects reveals an **orderliness** and a social structure that is truly amazing. For example, bees in a particular **hive** have a **distinct** **odor**; therefore, when an **interloper** seeks access,* they can identify him quickly and repulse* his invasion.

### QUEENS, WORKERS, DRONES

Each colony of honeybees consists of three classes: a) the queen who is a **prolific** layer of eggs; b) the worker who is the **bulwark** of the colony; and c) the **sedentary** **drone** whose only function is to mate with a young queen. The queen lays the eggs that **hatch** into thousands of female workers; some queens live as long as five years and lay up to one million eggs. The **frugal** worker builds and maintains the nest, collects and stores the honey, and is the **antithesis** of the lazy drone, or male honeybee, who does not work and has no sting. When the drone is no longer needed, the workers, in effect, **liquidate*** him by letting him starve to death. It’s a cruel, cruel world!

### SPOTLIGHT ON THE WORKER

Let us examine the activities of the **altruistic** workers in greater detail. After the workers have constructed a hive of **waterproof** **honeycomb** (made from beeswax), the queen begins to lay eggs in the first cells. While some workers **embellish** the hive, others fly out in search of **nectar and pollen**. With their long tongues they gather nectar, and use their hind legs to carry the pollen from the flowers. They fly directly back to the hive and then dance around the honeycomb, their movements indicating the direction of the flowers. Meanwhile, other workers have been cleaning cells, caring for the young, and guarding the precious **cache** of nectar. Another special **coterie** is **entrusted** with heating or cooling the hive. **Dedicated** to the welfare of the queen and the entire insect community, all of these workers display a complete absence of **cupidity**.

### THE SAGA OF THE QUEEN BEE

Although the **virtuosity** of the workers is remarkable, the queen bee is really the main story. Workers choose a few **larvae** to be queens, feeding them **royal jelly**, a substance rich in **proteins** and vitamins. While the queen is changing from a larva to a **pupa**, a team of workers builds a special cell for her. Soon the young queen hatches, eats the prepared honey, and grows strong. After she kills any rivals who have the **temerity** to challenge her, an **amorous** note is injected. She flies from the hive and mates with one or more drones on her first flight. Then the process of egg laying begins. When her **progeny** **saturate** the hive, **scouts** are **dispatched** to find a new location, and the **bees swarm** after their leader to begin the amazing cycle again.

### A PLAN TO FOOL THE NAZIS

One of the truly remarkable stories of World War II concerns a **ruse*** that was **perpetrated** with such **consummate** skill that it saved the lives of many Allied troops and helped to shorten the war. The simple, bold, and ingenious **subterfuge**, which British officers **concocted**, is the subject of Ewen Montagu’s classic, The Man Who Never Was. In short, the idea was to plant **fallacious** documents concerning the Allied invasion of Europe upon a dead officer, have his body recovered by agents who would transmit the false information to Germany, and then observe the effects of the plan.

### “MAJOR MARTIN” GOES TO WAR

After Commander Montagu and his colleagues had been given official approval for their dangerous **escapade**, they encountered **manifold** problems. First, they conducted an **assiduous** search for a body that looked as though it had recently been killed in an airplane disaster. Then, a detailed history of the man had to be invented that would be so **impeccable** that the enemy would accept its **authenticity**. This meant documents, love letters, personal effects, keys, photographs, etc. Each step was **fraught with** difficulty, but the **schemers** were unbelievably resourceful. As a result, in the late spring of 1942, “Major Martin” was prepared to do his part for his country.

### THE PLOT THICKENS

A submarine took the body out to sea. Then, “Major Martin,” the man who never existed, was slid into the **murky** Atlantic waters off the coast of Huelva, Spain. Attached to this **courier**’s coat was a briefcase that contained the components of the **hoax**. Shortly thereafter, the Spanish Embassy notified the British that the body had been recovered. But Commander Montagu learned that the important documents had already been scrutinized* and later **resealed** so that the British would not be **suspicious**. The secret information was transmitted to the German High Command, through a **labyrinth** of underground networks, to be evaluated. Now the true test of the months of assiduous* planning would come—the question remained, would the Germans **swallow the bait**?

### A PUZZLE FOR HIS MAJESTY

The **conspirators** had reason to **exult**, for all evidence **attested** to the fact that the German High Command was **gullible** about “Major Martin.” Their defense troops were moved away from the true invasion sites and **deployed** to areas that were **inconsequential**. Subsequently, when the actual attack took place, Allied **casualties** were minimized. After the war, Commander Montagu received a medal from the king of England. At the presentation ceremony, the king politely inquired where the young officer had earned his **citation**. “At the Admiralty,” Montagu replied, presenting the king with a **genuine** **enigma**.

## W18

### TEACHING CHIMPANZEES TO TALK

Two resourceful* psychologists at the University of Nevada have made splendid progress in vocabulary development in chimpanzees. Following a number of **abortive** attempts to teach French, German, or English to chimps, the researchers persevered* until they hit upon the American Sign Language system that is often used by deaf persons. They have had to modify the language somewhat in order to **accommodate** the animals’ **spontaneous** gestures. With a mixture of **innate** movements and learned ones, some **laboratory** chimps now have an extensive vocabulary.

### CHIMPANZEES ARE SMART

Washoe, the chimpanzee, has more than **a veneer of** intelligence; she can signal her desire to eat, go in or out, be covered, or brush her teeth. In addition, she can make signs for “I’m sorry,” “I hurt,” “Hurry,” “Give me,” and **a myriad of** other terms that are familiar to young children. This **urbane** animal can indicate that she **craves** more dessert by putting her fingers together (“more”) and then placing her index and second fingers on top of her tongue (“sweet”). It is **irrelevant** that Washoe cannot actually talk. What is important, is the **consummate*** ease with which she has mastered her daily assignments.

### EASY TO TRAIN

The chimpanzees are **deemed** by scientists to be the closest to humans of all the living apes; **consequently**, they are **fairly easy** to train. Several years ago, two married researchers **embarked** on an interesting project: they **reared** and trained a chimp in almost the same manner as they would have raised a child. The animal did beautifully, convincing the couple of the **inherent** ability of the chimpanzee. **Cinema buffs** who have seen Tarzan’s clever apes **romp** through the **jungle** also recognize the **latent** intelligence of these animals.

### MORE FACTS ABOUT CHIMPS

Chimps in the laboratory have **demonstrated** their ability to find their way out of the most **tortuous maze.** They can press buttons, **manipulate** levers, avoid shocks, etc. When food is placed out of reach, the animals can prepare a ladder of boxes to reach it. In his natural habitat,* the chimpanzee is considered **itinerant**. He goes his nomadic* way through the jungle, living on fruit, insects, and vegetables. With the aid of his long, powerful hands he can swing rapidly from tree to tree and cover considerable ground in his **peregrinations**. Chimps are loyal in their **conjugal** relationships, taking only one mate at a time. That may be another **barometer** of these animals’ superior intelligence.

## W19

### TROUBLE IN RURITANIA

King Andre of Ruritania was afflicted* with **megalomania**, and the people of his country suffered as a result. After ten years of his **profligate** rule, the treasury was bankrupt, unemployment was rampant,* domestic **strife** was mounting, and the number of the king’s opponents who were incarcerated* was **legion**. Following a bloodless **coup**, his nephew, Prince Schubert, took command of the poor nation.

### PRINCE SCHUBERT IN ACTION

Prince Schubert’s first move was to declare an **amnesty** for political prisoners and to invite home all Ruritanian **expatriates**. Those who had been jailed on false charges were **exonerated** by special **tribunals**. The young leader announced that he would abrogate* all of the oppressive **fiats** that his predecessor had promulgated.* Things began to look up temporarily for the citizens who perceived in Prince Schubert the sincerity, idealism, and honesty that had been lacking in the **mendacious** King Andre.

### REFORM MOVEMENT

In order to improve Ruritania’s financial position, an astute* but **parsimonious** treasurer was installed and given wide **pecuniary** powers. He tried to get the little country **back on its feet** by slashing all waste from its budget, **dismantling** King Andre’s **sumptuous** palaces, and firing all incompetents. In addition, Prince Schubert was able to get the United States to **underwrite** a **substantial** loan that would enable him to start a program of public works. Even so, Ruritania was still in desperate trouble.

### DISAPPOINTMENT AND DEDICATION

When Prince Schubert asked for additional **restrictive** measures, the people began to **balk**. Speaking on radio, the young reformer explained the reasons for higher taxes and food rationing; he was **blunt** when he stated the need for personal sacrifices. Nevertheless, the resistance to reform was great, and **nostalgia** for the “good old days” of King Andre began to grow. The people admitted that graft and corruption had been **rife** under Andre, but at least “everybody got his slice of the pie.” Although Prince Schubert was tempted to quit, he determined that he would help the people in spite of themselves.

## W20

### LA CUCARACHA—THE COCKROACH

The poor cockroach has been called the “most **reviled** creature on the face of the earth.” Nobody loves him—except, perhaps, another cockroach. Fiction, nonfiction, and poetry are replete* with **derogatory** references to these ubiquitous* bugs. Public health officials are quick to **indict** the insects as carriers of viruses that cause yellow fever and **polio**. Although past evidence was somewhat **nebulous**, studies show that an **allergy** to roaches may contribute significantly to asthma. Little wonder, therefore, that the **pesky** cockroach is under attack.

### WAITER, PLEASE TAKE THIS BOWL OF SOUP BACK TO THE KITCHEN

In addition to menacing our health, cockroaches are smelly, **filthy**, and ugly. Upon entering a cellar that is **redolent** with their aroma, you are not likely to forget the odor. And when you spy the **foul** culprits* creating havoc* in your sugar bowl or in **repose** atop your chocolate cake, your disposition may be exacerbated.* Roaches are **omnivorous** and will feast upon such **disparate** items as wallpaper, upholstery, nylon stockings, and beer. No one can accuse the hungry and thirsty bugs of being **abstemious**.

### THE ROACH LIVES ON

Cockroaches are the oldest **extant** winged insects, having been traced back over 350 million years. They have endured the **vicissitudes** of weather, natural disasters, war, and planned liquidation.* They reside comfortably in caves in South America, in transcontinental airplanes, on mountain tops, in Park Avenue **edifices**, and in television sets. The climate may be **sultry** or **frigid** but roaches persevere.* In the words of one writer, “The miraculous survival of the roach is explained by its inherent* adaptability.” In fact, a **trenchant** analysis made the point that roaches can survive a nuclear war.

### TONGUE IN CHEEK*?

The U.S. Public Health Service admits to **frustration*** in its attempts to destroy the cockroach. As soon as the scientists devise a **puissant** chemical, some bugs succumb.* But the hardy ones survive and breed a resistant strain. Since the average female produces close to three hundred descendants, little hope is held out for a final solution to the roach problem. Nevertheless, extermination campaigns continue **unabated**. Surprisingly, some sentimental souls become **maudlin** as they consider the persecution of the insects. A writer **noted for his levity** made a **lugubrious** plea for a crash program of aid for the cockroach, calling him “a victim of his slum environment.”
