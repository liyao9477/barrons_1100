## W5 Money

### Financial Systems

The great unsettled question of economics is: “How much should the government regulate business?” Conservatives generally argue for a decline in government involvement, but they favor certain subsidies to farmers, steelmakers, or airplane manufacturers. Some conservatives also see no conflict between their small-government views and their eagerness for the government to allocate more money for roads into national forests. The net result of these incursions into national forests is a tangible infrastructure that helps some companies but not the public. Publicly owned trees, land, and oil become commodities from which a few private companies (many owned by small-government conservatives) profit. No per capita benefit goes to the American people, **aside perhaps from** the brief anti-inflation effect that comes with new oil exploration.

### Wealth and Social Class

The United States is not the land of equal opportunity.There are no titles of nobility as in Europe, but astounding affluence is passed on in privileged families, and this makes all the difference. **Studies in the 1970s** found that a child of the elite and a child of the working class may start out with similar intelligence and drive, but the rich child is about 30 times more likely to prosper. The rich child goes to high-prestige schools, where his or her education may be only slightly above average, but where the child accumulates friendships with future leaders. The privileged child becomes comfortable with luxury and is at ease in situations where powerful people meet.The working-class child from a less-prestigious college is not likely to wind up impoverished, but neither is he or she likely to attend many parties of Yale or Vassar alumni.

### Personal Property

It is not easy to make a living as the proprietor of apartment buildings. There is a huge initial expense, not only to acquire the properties but to assess the buildings and to remove any hazardous materials like leadbased paint. A landlord also has to buy the best liability insurance available just to safeguard the investment. Otherwise, one tragic accident could wipe out the value of the entire asset. Because of this expense, it’s rare to find a sole individual owning such a property.The risk is more often taken on jointly by a group of investors who then split the profits from the leases.

### Employment

In the 1960s and 1970s, America was reaching the end of its role as a manufacturing power. Old-style systems of compensation, especially company pension plans, were impoverishing many companies. Much to the disadvantage of less-industrious workers, companies started demanding merit, not just seniority, before someone could be promoted. Many managers who were only marginally effective were encouraged to resign. These changes were painful, but unavoidable, symptoms of a growth spurt in the U.S. economy. Economies grow and change just as people do. A truly enterprising businessperson knows how to exploit these large changes and become involved in tomorrow’s dynamic businesses, not yesterday’s. There’s still plenty of money to be made in America, a very effective incentive for workers to adapt to new conditions.

### International Trade

Tomatoes, potatoes, and hot peppers, all originally from South or Central America, are among several plants that have disproportionately influenced cooking around the world. This happened only after a few intrepid eaters got beyond common fears about potatoes, tomatoes, and other products. Entrepreneurial hunters for new food products hardly knew what they were haggling for when they tried to extract from foreign markets goods that would sell well at home. Shuttling between Europe and exotic lands, Italians, Spaniards, and Britons in particular brought back food prototypes that were not obviously good things to eat—cinnamon bark, cousins of the dreaded nightshade(tomatoes), and even the pollen from a crocus flower (saffron). **As a glance at** international cookbooks will show, many creative merchants were well rewarded not just with financial success, but with culture-changing influence.

## W6 Government and Justice

### Politics

In the history of U.S. presidential elections, the year 1876 stands out as one of the oddest.That year, polls suggested that one person had won the popular vote but another had won more official electoral votes—just as happened in the year 2000. In 1876, however, the election was so bitterly contested that a special electoral commission was given the authority to determine which candidate—Republican Rutherford B. Hayes or Democrat Samuel J. Tilden—had won. This commission represented a coalition of interests.The Democrats favored this because otherwise the head of the Senate, Republican Thomas Ferry, would probably have been allowed to declare the winner. In the end, the Democrats were disappointed, as the commission advocated the Republican cause. The situation was not settled until March 2 of 1877, only three days before the scheduled inauguration of a new president—Hayes, **as it turned out**. Only then did America find out who its new leader would be.Americans seem not to have learned many lessons from 1876, however, because in 2000 there was still no official policy on how to settle an election that hung on a few contested votes. The problem was settled (by the Supreme Court) much faster in 2000, but still, no real system had been set up to deal with the situation.

### A Reasonable Doubt

One of the most controversial murder cases of the twentieth century was that involving the death of Marilyn Sheppard in 1954. Her husband, Dr. Sam Sheppard, was accused of killing her and then injuring himself. An unlikely suspect, Sheppard was highly respected by his peers in the medical world. Still, there were odd aspects to the murder that Sheppard could not explain away. Unfortunately for Sheppard, none of his supporters actually witnessed the crime, so nobody could back up Sheppard’s claim that the real killer was a bushy-haired man whom Sheppard had chased across his lawn and fought with briefly.

Sheppard was eventually convicted of the offense, but many people doubted the verdict. With aggressive help from a lawyer named F. Lee Bailey, Sheppard got a new trial. Bailey suggested many alternatives to Sheppard’s guilt, enough that the new jury could not say he was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Sheppard was released from prison but died soon afterward. His son, Chip, pursued the case through several civil and criminal proceedings in an attempt to find out the truth about his mother’s murder. Late in the 1990s, new DNA analysis techniques proved that someone other than Sam Sheppard and his family had been in the house that night. Sheppard’s story about the bushy-haired man had probably been accurate all along.

### The Police

The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects citizens from unreasonable search and seizure. Some civil libertarians have condemned the federal antidrug bureaucracy for threatening this basic right. In a drug case, police need no evidence to intrude on private property, apprehend a suspected dealer, and seize all the person’s property. Property taken under this law may be sold for a profit later by the law-enforcement officials involved in the raid. The target of a raid might be implicated only by an unreliable report from an unfriendly neighbor. The police are not required to ascertain whether there’s any physical evidence of drug activity at the site. In one case, surveillance of a large California property convinced local authorities to seize it—not because they saw drug activity but because the property was worth a lot of money. The property was taken, and its owner was shot trying to defend himself. A later inquiry determined that there were no illegal drugs on the property.

### Investigating Crimes

In 1979, two British farmers reported that, while sitting on a hill, they suddenly saw the crops below flattened in a perfect circle.They inferred that some great force must have come down directly from above to squash the corn and barley. This started a public hysteria about so-called crop circles.The patterns pressed into the crops (not all of them were circles) seemed to have no entry or exit points. Many people hypothesized that only alien spaceships could make such bizarre imprints. Others, including Britain’s police, assailed such wild conclusions. They had a contrary theory: Someone was playing a big hoax. Teams of investigators took samples of the plants and the soil, trying to objectively analyze the crop circles as if they were a crime scene. Public curiosity often impaired the investigators, who had to tolerate busloads of tourists flocking to the circles. The farmers in the area, long suspicious of the police, approached the case as an instance of police versus the people. If the local farmers knew the circles were a hoax, they wouldn’t say so.

### Government Corruption

In many countries, few politicians have enough integrity to resist corruption and bribery. Because such practices are so prevalent, officials often evade any personal sense of guilt by pretending that everyone is just as corrupt as they are. Even in cases of really grotesque corruption, the kind that might cause a scandal in a less-corrupt government, the general population may not be shocked. Instead, they may cynically conclude that government corruption is natural and unavoidable. In this environment, the efforts of an honest politician to unmask corruption may be eroded by the public’s lack of interest, causing any efforts at reform to fail.

### Crimes at Sea

The Spanish explorer Pizarro’s abduction of the Inca King Atahualpa came in 1529. His men detained the king, coerced the Incas into paying a large ransom in gold and silver, and then intentionally killed the king anyway.Their conquest of Peru established the legendary Spanish MainSpanish holdings on the mainland of Central and South America. The predicament for Spain’s kings was how to get the riches of the New World to Spain. Pirates and privateers ruled the waves. To distort what was actually just robbery, the king of England issued “letters of marque,” licenses that turned certain pirates into agents of the British government. Their piracy against Spanish ships and Spanish gold was considered service to the king or queen of England.

Most pirates with such letters were social deviants anyway, and predictably, they became embarrassments to the British crown.In 1603,Britain’s King James I canceled all his government’s letters of marque. The many dangerous, unemployed pirates became buccaneers, a terrifying mix of tough characters that operated from the island of Hispaniola. They conducted merciless raids on Spanish settlements and formed a brotherhood known for theft,torture,smuggling, and villainy of all sorts.

### The War on Drugs

Illegal addictive drugs, like heroin or cocaine, come from plants grown and harvested mostly by poor farmers.Their small farmhouses juxtaposed with the mansions of billionaire drug lords illustrate the unequal payouts to various players in the drug trade.The farmers sell their product cheaply to a drug-distribution cartel that is owned by the drug lords. People working for the cartel then refine the drugs into a concentrated form, or even modify them chemically to make them more potent and therefore more valuable. Other cartel members then transport the drugs to distributors for sale, smuggling them over huge distances, including international borders. Governments try to interdict smugglers, using both new technology and old (like sniffer dogs) to find residual traces of drugs. Their occasional successes have led to a popular misconception that antidrug campaigns are close to stopping the flow of illegal drugs. On the contrary, as long as drug lords can make vast fortunes in their illegal trade, smugglers will come up with ever-more-subtle ways of concealing their goods, and the War on Drugs goes on.

## W7 Relationships

### Family Relationships

The nature of the family varies widely from culture to culture. In some societies, family members tend to stay in close proximity to their kin, never moving more than a few miles away from the ancestral home. In other places, while the members of one generation may all live near one another, their descendants in the next generation scatter widely. In such a case, it’s difficult to maintain the same family cohesion enjoyed by those who live close together. Sometimes marriage can govern family structure; for example, there may be strict traditions requiring a new bride to leave her paternal home and siblings to move in with her new husband’s family. Such traditions are followed, even by young couples who don’t like them, because going against them is likely to result in the loss of inheritance. Whatever one’s own sentiments about family structure, it is important to recognize that one culture’s family system is as legitimate as another’s.

### Friendship

You can walk into any high school and spot the cliques: the jocks hang out here, the geeks there, the Goths and preppies in their areas.Teenagers feel a strong need to belong to a group, to associate with people with whom they share common interests or goals. Since adolescence is often a time when teens feel turmoil in their home lives, they seek affection and friendship outside the home.They look for other young people to bond with when their parents don’t seem to “understand.” Teens going through the various crises of adolescence can more easily confide in others their own age, with whom they have more in common.Teen cliques are by no means exclusive; membership can fluctuate on an almost daily basis, but the important thing is that group members feel a sense of solidarity and are willing to stick together.

### Passion

Perhaps no emotion is more complex than passion. Passion can show itself in a negative way as a burst of anger, or in a more pleasant way, as love. Passion can engender blind devotion for a lover or plunge a person into despondent misery if he or she feels a lack of reciprocity in the relationship. Passion and love cause innumerable dilemmas, and people constantly seek out ways to understand these emotions, as evidenced by the proliferation of articles, books, talk shows, and Web pages devoted to relationships. Many of these forums have loyal followings and have become cultural fixtures. The endless flow of information and opinions about the complex situations aroused by passion will probably not vanish anytime soon.

### Negative Emotions

Some radio talk show hosts are masters of obnoxious insults. Callers to such shows should be prepared for humiliation if they dare to disagree with the host’s views.The host controls whether the caller can speak, so he can arrogantly berate the caller without allowing the caller to respond. Some shows, especially on AM radio, have hosts who are contemptuous of nearly everyone. They regularly use vitriolic language to stigmatize whole groups of people, such as foreigners, liberals, gays, or women. Some hosts don’t actually despise the groups they insult. They simply use antipathy as a form of entertainment, and they seem to feel no shame about the damage they do.

## W8 Culture

### Social Rebels

Many adolescents and young adults go through a period when they rebel against what they perceive as an insincere world. Teens may take up causes such as radical environmentalism, protesting against the status quo.They may choose clothes that annoy their parents and associate with people from the fringes of society.This is a delicate period in a person’s life, full of chances to make bad decisions that could lead to juvenile delinquency and even jail. **Conversely**, it can be a time of personal discovery that strengthens teens in a moral rejection of hedonistic lifestyles.At this age they may fearlessly speak up against hypocritically self-righteous authorities and against manipulation by the news media.These adolescent protests can lead to conflicts within families and communities, but stirring things up can also lead to serious reflection and positive change.

### Painting and Sculpture

Whether something is “art”is largely a matter of opinion.Art that most people consider to have no intrinsic value can contain a great treasure of ideas and invention to someone who sees something special in it. Styles in all the arts range over a wide spectrum. Some good art is esthetically unchallenging and easy to understand. Other works are strange forms, totally out of context to everyone but the artist. One artist’s portrayal of an everyday object, such as a bouquet of flowers, may be grounded in realism and easily recognizable. Another painter’s depiction of the same bouquet may be very abstract, resembling flowers only in the artist’s mind. Regardless of the artist’s approach, the best art reveals new dimensions of experience and looks at the world from a fresh perspective.

### The Written Word

Johannes Gutenberg’s ingenious use of movable type in his printing press had a wide range of effects on European societies. Most obviously, readers no longer had to decipher odd handwriting, with ambiguous lettering, in order to read a written work. Gutenberg gave each letter standard forms, a move that had connotations far beyond the printing business.The inscriptions on tombstones and roadside mileposts, for example, could now be standardized.The cost of books decreased. Even illiterate people benefited indirectly from the advent of this invention, as the general level of information in society increased. However, Gutenberg’s press was of limited use for languages that used picture-like symbols for writing instead of a phonetic system. Systems of symbolic pictographs, each of which denotes a word, require many thousands of characters to be cast into lead type by the printer. Phonetic systems, like the Latin alphabet, use the same few characters, recombined in thousands of ways to make different words.

### Entertainment

When the artistic medium of theater falls into the hands of college students, the results can be unpredictable. At one college, we saw Shakespeare’s Hamlet done as musical theater.The idea was bad to start out with, and the actual play was amateurish, bordering on incompetent. The cast did not understand the tragic power of the play. Their improvisation when they forgot their lines was silly and inappropriate.The costumes and set design looked homemade, like something from an elementary-school skit.Three months later, however, this same group of students did a great job with the comedy A Midsummer Night’s Dream. Surprisingly enough, the actors were charismatic, played their parts with zeal, and achieved a hilarious result. It was no gala event, but we still felt that it was one of the best performances we had seen.

### Risky Fashions

The fashion industry encourages people to spend far too much time and money on clothes. It’s natural for humans to use clothing as a mark of belonging to a group and to try to keep up with style trends. The fashion industry exploits this natural desire and turns it into a capricious, impractical, and expensive rush from one style to another. For example, in one recent year, fashion did an abrupt about-face. Early in the year, fashionable outfits showed a minimum amount of fabric and a maximum amount of skin. By late summer, famous fashion designers were drowning people in bulky, cumbersome outfits that looked five sizes too big. Vanity inhibits people from looking realistically at exotic clothing fads.A striking new style catches their eye, they look at the clothes they’re wearing, and they are suddenly vulnerable to the manipulation of the fashion industry.
