## W5 Money

### Financial Systems

The great unsettled question of economics is: “How much should the government regulate business?” Conservatives generally argue for a decline in government involvement, but they favor certain subsidies to farmers, steelmakers, or airplane manufacturers. Some conservatives also see no conflict between their small-government views and their eagerness for the government to allocate more money for roads into national forests. The net result of these incursions into national forests is a tangible infrastructure that helps some companies but not the public. Publicly owned trees, land, and oil become commodities from which a few private companies (many owned by small-government conservatives) profit. No per capita benefit goes to the American people, **aside perhaps from** the brief anti-inflation effect that comes with new oil exploration.

### Wealth and Social Class

The United States is not the land of equal opportunity.There are no titles of nobility as in Europe, but astounding affluence is passed on in privileged families, and this makes all the difference. **Studies in the 1970s** found that a child of the elite and a child of the working class may start out with similar intelligence and drive, but the rich child is about 30 times more likely to prosper. The rich child goes to high-prestige schools, where his or her education may be only slightly above average, but where the child accumulates friendships with future leaders. The privileged child becomes comfortable with luxury and is at ease in situations where powerful people meet.The working-class child from a less-prestigious college is not likely to wind up impoverished, but neither is he or she likely to attend many parties of Yale or Vassar alumni.
