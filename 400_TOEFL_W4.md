## W1 Nature

### Food Crops

In countries like Niger and Mauritania, the cultivation of land has changed little in the past several centuries. Additionally, these countries’ mono-modal rainfall pattern brings precipitation for only three months during the year. As a result, food production doesn’t nearly meet demand.

Several agencies and organizations have intensified their efforts to increase the productivity of land in these countries.They have introduced new strains of seed, improved irrigation techniques, and introduced new methods of fertilization and soil management. With ample sunlight for photosynthesis and modern irrigation techniques, sustainable farming techniques should allow farmers to boost aggregate production in order to meet demand.

Still, crop revitalization faces an unexpected adversary: institutional incompetence.Where crop specialists have convinced individual farmers to abandon old farming techniques in place of new, they can’t readily obtain the governmental cooperation they need.The biggest hurdles are political corruption, incompetence, and the absence of a marketing infrastructure.

### Disaster

Nature challenges humans in many ways, through disease, weather, and famine. For those living along the coast, one unusual phenomenon capable of catastrophic destruction is the tsunami (pronounced “tsoo-NAH-mee”). A tsunami is a series of waves generated in a body of water by an impulsive disturbance. Earthquakes, landslides, volcanic eruptions, explosions, and even the impact of meteorites can generate tsunamis. Starting at sea, a tsunami slowly approaches land, growing in height and losing energy through bottom friction and turbulence. Still, just like any other water waves, tsunamis unleash tremendous energy as they plunge onto the shore. They have great erosion potential, stripping beaches of sand, undermining trees, and flooding hundreds of meters inland.They can easily crush cars, homes, vegetation, and anything they collide with. To minimize the devastation of a tsunami, scientists are constantly trying to anticipate them more accurately and more quickly. Because many factors come together to produce a life-threatening   tsunami, foreseeing them is not easy. **Despite this**, researchers in meteorology persevere in studying and predicting tsunami behavior.

### Evolution and Migration

The migration from Asia to North America across the Bering Strait (perhaps by land bridge) was a monumental event in human history.The process of overspreading the Americas took more than 1,000 years, or 30 generations.This might seem to confirm common sense—that slow travel was inherent in any great migration without wheeled vehicles across unknown terrain. **Further thought** shows that this process was remarkably fast—about 10 northsouth miles per year, on average. The Americas were populated at an astounding pace, when one considers the physical limits of the human body and the physical features of the American continents. Legs of humans can move only so fast under the best of circumstances, and they work even slower over mountain passes or deserts. Populations spread through the diverse regions of the Americas (grasslands, eastern forests, coastal swamps) and needed to adapt to their new environments.The migrants’ lifestyle had evolved over the years to that of professional nomads ensuring that they would find the resources needed to survive.

### Petroleum Alternatives

Human consumption of fossil fuels is expected to fully deplete the Earth’s crude oil reserves by the year 2060.As underground reservoirs of oil continue to shrink, we have no choice but to find alternatives. **One promising source**, with much cleaner emissions, is called bio-diesel. Biodiesel is often made from soybean oil, although it can be made from any vegetable oil that is not elementally different from soy. Bio-diesel can even be made from used cooking oils that homes or restaurants would otherwise dispose of. Bio-diesel can be used without constraint in any vehicle that runs on diesel—no modifications are needed. Presently, diesel engines can take up to 20 percent soy in their soy-diesel blend.As the need for bio-diesel increases and the technology improves, we may soon witness the extinction of the fossil-fueled vehicle.This is good news for the planet, as bio-diesel is a more stable source of energy than petroleum, and it reduces contamination of our air and water.

## W2 Science

### Time Efficiency

Time is, as we all know, money. Such valuation of time leads people to extreme efforts to maximize their use of time. Some people obsess over knowing the exact time. They buy clocks and watches that automatically adjust themselves over the Internet or by radio waves.These measurements allow them infinitesimal accuracy in dealing with time. Regardless of how one tracks time, most people share a common goal: They want to use time effectively. Since about 1982, this efficiency has increased exponentially each year, thanks to computers and their ability to multitask. In multitasking, a computer executes several different tasks in parallel. Rather than being set arbitrarily, each task is given a priority in the computer’s operating system, and time is spent in proportion to the priority of the task.The computer executes different sequences of tasks at different clock cycles, thereby increasing the rate of output from a process.

### Ancient Life

Organic products from ancient life are an integral part of the Earth’s resources, offering scientists a more accurate picture of ancient life-forms. One key to ancient life comes in the form of petrified matter. Petrifaction is a process that slowly turns the remains of a living object into stone. In this process, minerals seep into a mass of organic matter.After the organic matter has been replaced, a mineral version of the living object is left. Petrifaction often occurs in trees that are found adjacent to rivers, floodable areas, and volcanoes, which provide the mud or ash that initially covers the organic matter. Some pieces of petrified wood retain the original cellular structure of the wood and the grain can be easily seen. Today, it is feasible to petrify wood in a simple laboratory process.

Fossils are another way that ancient life is preserved. Most fossils include an animal’s hard parts, such as teeth and bones. One type of fossil, called a trace fossil, may also include eggs, tooth marks, contents of the guts, and fossil excrement. Some products from ancient life offer us more than scientific knowledge. One such product is coal, a solid fuel of plant origin. It develops over millions of years, during which swamp vegetation is submerged in water, depleted of oxygen, and covered by layers and layers of sand and mud. These overlapping layers settle with the Earth’s movements and are compressed over time.

### Computers

As dependence on computers increases, so does the need for technical support. From installation of software to detection of viruses, computers require constant vigilance. Most larger companies find it most expeditious to maintain in-house computer staff. Many smaller companies, however, can’t fund their own full-time, in-house technical help. Instead, many of them assign the task of computer maintenance to a current employee who may not have any formal training. Rather, these “computer buffs” have derived their skills through practice and self-training. These self-appointed tech specialists, however, often cannot solve bigger problems. What’s more, they may see their office relations corrode when they are swamped with basic user questions that they simply don’t have time to address. For these reasons, many small companies choose to employ a freelance technical assistant who circulates among clients on an as-needed basis. With their professional training, these consultants may propose innovative solutions to users’ unique needs, which could vary from tracking inventory to simulating mechanized processes. They can implement new programs, train personnel, and escape the workplace before being asked,“How can I cut this file and paste it somewhere else?”

### Energy

Most of the electricity in the United States is produced in steam turbines. There are many discrete steps in this process. In a steam turbine, combustion of coal, petroleum, or natural gas heats water to make steam. The steam rotates a shaft that is connected to a generator that produces electricity. Finally, that electricity is converted by a transformer and conveyed from the turbine to its place of use. Many sources can provide energy to heat the water in a steam turbine. Coal is primary, producing 51 percent of the country’s electricity.Another common way to heat water for steam turbines is through nuclear power. In nuclear fission, atoms of uranium fuel are hit by neutrons, triggering a continuous chain of fission that releases heat. In 2001, nuclear power generated 21 percent of the electricity in the United States. Solar power produces less than 1 percent of the United States’ electricity needs, because it is not regularly available and harnessing it is more expensive than using fossil fuels. Dependence on electricity permeates daily life in the United States. **Still**, few people are aware of the many components of electricity production.

## W3 Mind and Body

### Memory

Like other functions of the human mind, perception and memory are imperfect.When we tell a story about something that we witnessed, we may intuitively believe that our recollection is accurate. However, several factors bias our memories of events.To study this anomaly, let us look at the three steps of memory creation: acquisition of memory, storing of memory, and retrieval. At every stage of memory formation, distortion can occur. At the first stage, acquisition of memory, events are perceived and bits of information are prepared for storage in the brain. However, it is impossible for us to remember every single thing we observe. Through processes that are both conscious and unconscious, people determine which details they will focus on.

In its second stage, storage, memories can become further distorted. Over time, our memories degrade, as we forget portions of events. To compensate, we may even creatively fill in the gap created by the recession of long-term memory.Additionally, an individual’s memory can be altered during the storage stage by intervening occurrences, which can be subconsciously combined with previously stored memories. Last but not least, we search our memory to locate information. During recall, emotion also seems to play a part in memory distortion. **In sum**, our memories may not be the indisputable source of information that we would like them to be.

### Spirituality

In Russia, several religions coexist, including Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and animism. The most common religion is Christianity, and most Christians are members of the Russian Orthodox Church. The Church has existed for over 1,000 years, surviving even the official atheism of the Soviet era and the agnosticism that may have been even more prominent at the time. During the communist years, many Russians who practiced Orthodoxy sacrificed career and educational opportunities.The tenacity of Russian Orthodoxy may explain why even nonreligious Russians are inclined to call themselves Russian Orthodox.That same staying power drives the Church today, which is run by Aleksey II of Moscow. Born Aleksey Mikhailovich Ridiger, the future patriarch was from a very pious family. As a boy, Aleksey was often taken by his parents on their annual pilgrimages, when he most certainly began contemplation of the religious way of life he was to choose. **As patriarch**,Aleksey is exalted in the Church governance, but he is not deified. Aleksey has published articles on Church history and peacemaking in both the ecclesiastical and secular press, broadening the Church’s image both in Russia and abroad.

### Illness

The man was decrepit.With high blood pressure, cancer, and liver disease, he aggravated his situation by smoking. His prognosis was death. His advanced lung cancer was terminal, and his family members knew that he would pass away soon. So no one was surprised to find him dead on that sharp winter Thursday, no one, that is, except one sharp-eyed detective, who noticed the bedroom window ajar on the morning of the old man’s death.Would a fatally ill person be likely to sleep with the window open on a freezing cold night?

This question occupied forensic specialists from the medical examiner’s office.There, an autopsy revealed an unlikely wound on the victim’s thigh. Such a wound could easily have been inflicted by someone administering medicine . . . or poison. From there, the poison could travel through the veins, shutting down vital organs and causing death within seconds. Indeed, the death turned out to be murder in the first degree.Criminal investigators persisted in their questioning of friends and family, only later finding the motive: money. Two distant relatives who stood to inherit large sums from the old man’s estate plotted the death,believing that the old man’s death would not be questioned.

### Surgery

Since 1992, the number of cosmetic surgery procedures has risen 175 percent in the United States.Two of the most popular are liposuction and breast augmentation. In liposuction,the doctor inserts a small tube into the skin that sucks fat from the body.And while it may sound easy,it isn’t.Liposuction is so painful that people are often given anesthesia. What’s more, liposuction is not really a cure for obesity. Rather, it should be used when diet and exercise do not reduce fat in certain “trouble spots.” Another common cosmetic procedure is breast augmentation. In this procedure, an implant is inserted through the armpit, making the breasts appear larger.Breast augmentation usually leaves only a small scar. Some common complications include the effects of anesthesia, infection, swelling, redness, bleeding, and pain. To reduce these risks, consumers are advised to be sure that their surgeon is board-certified.

### Ghosts

Some say that sailors are a superstitious group. Long nights of watching stars predispose them to a belief in astrology. Long periods of isolation lead them to believe in psychic phenomena that others would laugh at. This may explain sailors’ frequent reports of seeing phantom ships. From the Gulf of Mexico, across the Atlantic, and to the South China Sea, sailors often claim that such vessels haunt the seas. One of the most famous stories of ghost ships is the Flying Dutchman, which sailed in 1680 from Amsterdam to Dutch East India under Hendrick Vanderdecken.When the captain ignored the danger warnings of a storm, his ship was smashed and the crew was lost. According to legend, his arrogance invoked the wrath of God, who condemned the lost crewmembers to battle the waters off the Cape of Good Hope for eternity. Since then, there have been repeated sightings of the Flying Dutchman, one as recent as 1939. Many sightings of phantom ships occur in areas where vessels are known to have sunk. Sailors can never divine when or where they will next encounter a phantom ship. Rather, most of their sightings occur randomly,only later to bring forth information of a former sea horror. Some say that ghosts aboard a phantom ship are trying to use living sailors as their intermediaries. Still others think that the existence of phantom ships is merely a self-perpetuating myth for bored sailors who are prone to too much idle meditation about the meaning of life and death on the high seas.

### Anthropology

humans lived near Penrith, New South Wales, about 47,000 years ago. Australian aborigines migrated from northern lands by sea, when the water passages were narrower than they are today. This is the first evidence of sea travel by prehistoric humans.The saga of this water passing survives in modern-day aboriginal folklore. **To put this in perspective**, remember that 50,000 years ago, humans were nomadic. Early aborigines did not cultivate crops, and in Australia at the time there were no animals that could be domesticated. No one knows how long it took aboriginal people to reach Australia, but archaeologists are searching through ancient campsites for vestiges of their early lifestyle. Fossilized remains indicate that these nomadic people not only gathered food from the land, but they also subsisted on meat from large animals that no longer exist today. As part of their hunting tradition, aborigines ritually covered themselves in mud to mask their own scent or for camouflage.Aboriginal society marked the major events of life with rites such as circumcision, marriage, and cremation. Older people were revered and cared for as great sources of wisdom. When Westerners arrived in Australia in 1788, the 300,000 aborigines who lived there were not eager to assimilate their ways. In the following years, disease, loss of land, and loss of identity shaped the aborigines’ history perhaps as much as their first prehistoric crossing from the north.

### Social Inequality

Nelson Mandela devoted his life to fighting prejudice in South Africa. Mandela traveled his state, organizing a fight against discriminatory laws and racial bias. He encouraged civil disobedience as a tool against the oppression of Blacks. As deputy president of the African National Congress, Mandela encouraged his fellow citizens to challenge the prevailing paradigm of power. Mandela believed that prejudice burdened not only the oppressed, but also the oppressors.

The government countered Mandela’s activities with a criminal conviction. Still, Mandela’s de facto leadership gained him respect and authority among his fellow citizens. Mandela’s courage and popularity worried **the ruling class**, who did not want to share power. What’s more, they refused to amend the state’s laws. So when Mandela returned from an overseas trip to gain support for his cause in 1962, he was arrested, jailed, and sentenced to life in prison for various crimes. 

This only fueled Mandela’s notions about inequality and justice. He took his demands to jail, where he demanded the same dress and safety gear for Black prisoners as for White prisoners. After 28 years in prison, Mandela was released, returning immediately to public life. In 1994, he was elected the president of South Africa.

### Expertise

In the last three decades, universities across the United States have attempted to adapt their curriculums to meet the changing purposes of higher education. University education was also once considered an exclusive opportunity, with erudite scholars establishing courses based on the goal of training a distinctly academic “elite.” These days, not every undergraduate is destined to become a scholar, and the roster of students represents a more complete cross section of society, including minorities, women, and returning students. These days, most learners attend university to fortify basic skills, primarily learning how to learn and how to express themselves. Far from its earlier religious or elitist image, the university is seen increasingly as a secular center for career development, where students know they will graduate into a competitive job market. Most professors have embraced this evolution in the university’s role, letting go of the traditional, parochial view of higher education. On the other hand, many feel that while they want to accommodate an adaptable curriculum, universities must not suspend their obligation of establishing rigorous requirements for education and graduation. Implicit in their stance is support for the traditional liberal arts curriculum with a core of classes required across disciplines.

### Military Operations

**Until a century ago**, military medicine was poor at battling disease.The ratio of soldiers killed by diseases to those killed in combat was probably at least two to one. For strategic reasons, military camps were often set up near a body of water.This gave some protection from enemy artillery, but it exposed soldiers to diseasecarrying mosquitoes. Mosquitoes also plagued troops in the trenches. Low-ranking troops suffered the most. Officers who were advanced enough in the hierarchy slept in separate tents on high ground.

The long-held belief that disease resulted from evil spirits or bad air eventually ceased to rule military medicine.The germ theory mobilized actual science against disease. General George Washington ordered that his men be vaccinated against smallpox.Their allegiance to him can be measured by the fact that they obeyed, for Washington’s doctors used the actual smallpox virus, not the safer vaccination that Edward Jenner would introduce in 1798.

### War and Conquest

The Roman conquest of North Africa is, in the prevailing view, less interesting than Rome’s European adventures. In truth, one of the first lands Rome annexed beyond the Italian peninsula was the area around Carthage in North Africa. Carthage and Rome had been in conflict (called the Punic Wars) since 264 BCE for control of trade along the Mediterranean coast. In 202 BCE, during the Second Punic War, the Carthaginian general Hannibal devised a clever plan, in violation of most military wisdom, to march through the high Alps to attack the Roman heartland. The cold weather and steep terrain severely stressed Hannibal’s forces, many of whom rode elephants.The Romans resisted Hannibal’s attacks, and his bold invasion force collapsed. In the end, Rome finished off Carthage in the Third Punic War (149–146 BCE). At its apex in 117 CE, Rome controlled all of North Africa and territories from the Persian Gulf to Britain.

### History

Revisionist history promotes a new view of chronological events, usually for political purposes. Radical revisionists diminish the credibility of a previous view and may even deny that certain events happened at all. Some revisionist Asian historians have ignored long-standing conflicts among native peoples and have explained Asia’s conflicts as a consequence of colonialism and its class-oriented cultural milieu. **Good motives** among the revisionists—to promote reconciliation among traditional rivals—**don’t excuse bad history**. History is valuable only if its stories coincide with verifiable facts. From far away, an observer may see clearly that a given conflict had nothing to do with colonialism and a lot to do with 1,000-year-old rivalries. But this is not likely to matter much to a confirmed revisionist historian. At its core, revisionism—by the government in particular—is an Orwellian exercise in thought control, not honest science.
