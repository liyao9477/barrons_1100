### READING WISELY

The youngster who reads **voraciously**, though **indiscriminately**, does not necessarily gain in wisdom over the teenager who is more selective in his reading choices. A student who has read the life story of every **eminent** athlete of the twentieth century, or one who has **steeped** herself in every socialprotest novel she can get her hands on, may very well be learning all there is to know in a narrow area. But books are **replete** with so many wonders that it is often discouraging to see bright young people limit their own experiences.

1. The football game was ________________ with excitement and great plays.

2. The ________________ author received the Nobel Prize for literature.

3. My cousin is so ________________ in schoolwork that his friends call him a bookworm.

4. After skiing, I find that I have a ____________ appetite. 

5. Modern warfare often results in the ____________ killing of combatants and innocent civilians alike.

### SOLVING THE SERVANT PROBLEM

The worlds of science fiction **abound** with wonders. Yet modern technology progresses so rapidly that what is today’s wild dream may be next year’s kitchen appliance. A British scientist has **prognosticated** that within ten years every suburban **abode** will have its own robot servant. One task this domesticated **automaton** will not have to contend with will be scouring the oven because even today the newest ranges can be programmed to reduce their own baked-on grime to easily disposed of ash.

1. The mayor refused to ________________ as to his margin of victory in the election.

2. The time is approaching when human workers may be replaced by ________________.

3. Mel’s new two-bedroom ________________ overlooks a lake where many birds nest.

4. The western plains used to ________________ with bison before those animals were slaughtered by settlers.

5. Man may be freed from backbreaking labor by the products of scientific ________________.

### A LUCKY FIND ON THE SUBWAY?

Sylvia regularly took a crowded subway train to work during rush hour, so she found it to be a **paradox** one hot, steamy Tuesday to easily find a seat in a car that was nearly empty. She wondered how, in the **realm** of possibilities, this could be; how often in the **annals** of subway history had there been such a fortunate occurrence? To **compound** the puzzle, looking out the window she could see many commuters busily racing on the platform to fill other cars. It was not until she saw the sign on the door that she realized, with a **tinge** of resignation, why she had been so “lucky” this morning: “We apologize, but the air conditioning is not working in this car.”

1. His gloom was now ________________ by the failing mark on his geometry test.

2. The ________________ of sports are filled with great athletes of color.

3. One of the great ____________ of American life is that though minority groups have suffered injustices, nowhere in the world have so many varied groups lived together so harmoniously. 

4. A ____________ of garlic is all that’s necessary in most recipes.

5. The cruel king would not allow the prince to enter his ________________ , restricting him to the forest, which abounded* with wild animals.

### HOW NOT TO GET YOUR WAY

It is difficult to change someone’s opinion by **badgering** him. The child who begs his mother to “get off his back” when she **implores** him for some assistance with the household **drudgery**, may very well plead **interminably** for some special privilege when he wants something for himself. How paradoxical* that neither is able to **perceive** that no one likes being nagged.

1. She does her homework on Fridays to save herself from the ________________ of having to do it during the weekend.

2. The teacher continually ________________ the pupil for the missing assignments.

3. The eminent* scientist ________________ difficulties in putting the invention into practice.

4. The sick child’s mother ________________ the doctor to come immediately.

5. I listened to the boring lecture for what seemed an ________________ fifty minutes.

### TO THE POINT

Calvin Coolidge, our thirtieth president, was named “Silent Cal” by reporters because of his **laconic** speech. One Sunday, after Mr. Coolidge had listened to an interminable* sermon, a **throng** of newsmen gathered around him. An **intrepid** reporter **accosted** the Chief Executive: “Mr. President, we know that the sermon was on the topic of sin. What did the minister say?” “He was against it,” the **reticent** Coolidge replied.

1. His speech was usually rambling, but this time I found it brief and ________________ .

2. If a surly panhandler should ________________ you, keep on walking.

3. Even under repeated questioning, the witness remained ________________ .

4. A howling ________________ of teenage girls surrounded the pop stars.

5. The corporal received the Silver Star for his ________________ deeds in combat.
